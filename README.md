# 🚍 University Smart Bus and Route Management System

> A formal specification-based system design for a university’s smart transportation service.

This project models a university’s **Smart Bus and Route Management System** using formal methods to ensure correctness, clarity, and system reliability.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design a university's smart transportation system where buses, routes, schedules, and user interactions are managed logically.  
The system ensures:

- Safe and accurate operations using **formal specification techniques**
- Well-defined system rules using **Object Constraint Language (OCL)**
- Structural clarity with **UML diagrams**
- Operation safety with **pre/post conditions**
- Precise system behavior using **Z-Notation**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** – for diagrams like use-case, class, activity
- **OCL (Object Constraint Language)** – to add constraints to UML models
- **Z-Notation** – to define the mathematical structure of the system
- **Formal Specification** – for safe, secure design modeling
- **Visual Paradigm / Draw.io** – for diagram modeling (any tool you used)

---

## 🚀 How to Run / Use

Since this is a **design and specification-based project**, there is no executable code, but here’s how you can explore or use it:

1. Open the UML diagrams using any UML modeling tool (e.g., Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, or Draw.io)
2. Read OCL constraints and Z-Notation in the provided PDF/doc files
3. Validate system logic and flow via pre/post condition documentation
4. Extend the model to implement in any backend system (Java, Python, etc.)

> **Bonus Tip:** You can use this as a base to implement an actual transportation system with web/mobile frontend in future phases.
